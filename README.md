## Solana Vault Integration

This repository serves as a reference implementation for developers building vault applications, token management systems, or other DeFi applications on Solana. The demo video shows the complete flow of interacting with a Solana program from a web interface.

## Why This Project?

This project was created to understand and demonstrate how to properly connect a frontend application to a Solana smart contract built with Anchor. It addresses common challenges like:

- Program IDL integration
- Account data serialization/deserialization
- Transaction building and signing
- Error handling for on-chain operations
- State synchronization between blockchain and UI

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

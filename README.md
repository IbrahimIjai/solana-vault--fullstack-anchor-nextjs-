# Solana Full-Stack DApp Suite

Welcome to the **Solana Full-Stack DApp Suite**, a monorepo showcasing how to build decentralized applications (DApps) on the Solana blockchain. This project integrates Solana smart contracts (built with Anchor) with modern Next.js frontends, managed in a [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) structure.

<Callout type="info">
This project is perfect for developers looking to learn Solana DApp development, from smart contract deployment to building responsive React UIs.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project uses a Turborepo monorepo with the following structure:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault/          # Next.js app for Solana Vault
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ minter/        # Next.js app for NFT Minter
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/         # Solana smart contracts built with Anchor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # Root dependencies and Turborepo scripts
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   At the root of the repository, install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

2. **Build and Deploy Contracts**  
   Navigate to the `contracts/` folder and follow the [Anchor documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) to build and deploy Solana programs:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   anchor build
   anchor deploy
   ```

3. **Run Development Servers**  
   Start all Next.js apps using Turborepo:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```
   - The Vault app runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
   - The NFT Minter app runs on `http://localhost:3001`.
   - Open these URLs in your browser to explore the apps.

<Callout type="warning">
Ensure you have a Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom) installed and configured to interact with the apps.

## üåü Why This Project?

This project is designed to help developers understand and build Solana DApps by addressing key challenges:

- **Smart Contract Integration**: Seamlessly connect Anchor programs to Next.js frontends.
- **Data Handling**: Serialize and deserialize on-chain account data.
- **Transactions**: Build, sign, and submit transactions reliably.
- **Error Handling**: Manage on-chain errors gracefully.
- **State Sync**: Keep the UI in sync with blockchain state.
- **NFT Creation**: Implement end-to-end NFT minting with Metaplex.

## Components Overview

### Solana Vault Integration

This repository serves as a reference implementation for developers building vault applications, token management systems, or other DeFi applications on Solana. The demo video shows the complete flow of interacting with a Solana program from a web interface.

### NFT Minter with Metaplex/Sugar

The NFT minter component provides a complete implementation of NFT creation and management using Metaplex and Sugar. It demonstrates the entire minting process from metadata creation to on-chain minting.

## Why This Project?

This project was created to understand and demonstrate how to properly connect a frontend application to Solana smart contracts built with Anchor. It addresses common challenges like:

- Program IDL integration
- Account data serialization/deserialization
- Transaction building and signing
- Error handling for on-chain operations
- State synchronization between blockchain and UI
- NFT creation and metadata management
